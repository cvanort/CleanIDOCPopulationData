# Clean and Combine IDOC Population Data

IDOC publishes population data sets which consist of each person housed in a state prison each quarter and information about them, such as their demographics, the type of crime they're being held for, the date on which they were apprehended, etc. The data sets are .xls files, but the titles, URLs, and data within each data set differ and need to be cleaned. This script combines all population data sets and makes the information within them consistent.

The population data sets can be found here: https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/reportsandstatistics/Pages/Prison-Population-Data-Sets.aspx
